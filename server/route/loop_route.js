// Path-finding with the same start and ending points
// We use a combination of the cost models we developed for this application of Dijkstra's algorithm
// There are many ansyncronous requests in this model, so we use a chain of promises to execute it.
// Model progression:
// - Find all the nodes (referred to as "out nodes") within 1/3 to 1/2 of the requested total route distance
// - Find closest node to the requested start location
// - Run the k-paths version of Dijkstras to determine which out node has the lowest total cost from the start node-- this becomes the out-path for the loop
// - Get the geometry for the best out path
// - Find a **new** path from the end node of the out path -- force Dijkstra's to take a new path by multiplying the cost by the inverse distance from the original route
